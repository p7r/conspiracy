This is a repo for holding a graphviz .dot file that demonstrates odd relationships.

It produces this graphic:

![A graph](conspiracy.dot.png)

You may edit the dot file and then produce a new image with `dot conspiracy.dot -O -Tpng`

Please note: I do not believe there is a conspiracy, but when people talk about these conspiracies, it's worth taking into account relationships like this.
